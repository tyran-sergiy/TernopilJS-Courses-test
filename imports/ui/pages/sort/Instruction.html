      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>Array size have limit - <b>60000</b>, because i use the simplest implementation of <b>Bubble sort</b> to show how bad <b> Bubble Sort</b> compared to other.</p>
      <p><b>Insertion Sort</b> is nice choice instead of <b>Bubble Sort</b> for small data. But notice, that <b>Insertion Sort</b> have <b>worst</b> case complexity with<b> Reversed array</b> - executes almost two times longer</p>
      <p>As for me <b>Shell Sort</b> is best choice for almost all cases, except some exotic cases. It's a little slower than <b>Quick Sort</b> but does not create a stack that with large size crash your app, like this happened with me </p>
      <p><b>Start</b> and <b>Sorted</b> arrays you can see in browser console</p>
