             <div class="about-me-text">
               I`m just a third year student. I travel, but not enough.
               I have a lot of hobbies. All my life I try to find myself in something.
               At school I played guitar, drew, even tried to write a book.
               In the first year of university became interested in programming.
               It's cool feeling when you create something, especially difficult something.
               Then i try trekking.Mountains deeply entrenched in my soul. Now, I almost climber.
               However, I understand that I will not outstanding climber or writer, or rock star, or new Linus Torvalds.
               I couldn`t find any one true calling. For a long time I was worried by this.
               Once I came across the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling">TED Talk</a>,
               where exactly was described my situation. The greatest ideas are born at the intersection.
               This Talk helped me understand my role in this world. We are multipotentialite. <br>
               And now I can say, that  I'm a simple guy who smokes, sometimes playing guitar,
               drawing, stopped eating meat about 5 months ago, really like to travel, of course keen on innovations in programming and just enjoys life.
